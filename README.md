# Cromwell on Azure

## Overview
The DNAstack Cromwell installer uses Microsoft's [Cromwell on Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure)
installer and [Terraform](TERRAFORM.md) to create an installation of Cromwell using Azure Virtual Machines, Container Apps,
and Azure Batch, in Azure resource group.

An Azure Container App is used as the ingress for all requests to Cromwell, and calling this service requires an
Azure Active Directory token from a pre-configured Azure Application Registration.

### Resource Layout
The following represents the layout of resources, where items in italics are created as part of this installation:

* Active Directory Tenant
  * Azure Subscription
    * _Resource Group_
      * _Cromwell deployment (the exact infrastructure used depends on the CromwellOnAzure version and arguments)_
      * _Storage Account_
      * _Virtual Network_
      * _Log Analytics Workspace_
      * _Container App with external ingress_
  * _Application Registration (for authentication with ingress)_

## Prerequisites
To run this script, you must have the following prepared:
1. Pick an existing Azure subscription and find its ID
2. Install the `az` and `terraform` command-line tools.
3. _Optional_: Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) &mdash; this is used in documented commands for testing
   your installation, and is not required for installing the engine.

## Installation
1. Run the [CromwellOnAzure script](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure#Deploy-your-instance-of-Cromwell-on-Azure).
   This will require you to have installed the `az` client and authenticated with `az login`.

   **Important**: depending on the version of and arguments used with the CromwellOnAzure script, you will get different
   infrastructure generated by the script. This documentation supports Cromwell deployments in virtual machines
   (the default for versions [3.2.0](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/releases/tag/3.2.0) and earlier),
   and Cromwell deployments in an Azure Kubernetes cluster (the default for version
   [4.0.0](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/releases/tag/4.0.0) and later). Several of the following steps
   will depend on which of these approaches you take, so please take note of whether your installation is using a
   virtual machine or a Kubernetes cluster.
2. There are two different Terraform modules for Cromwell in a virtual machine and Cromwell in a Kubernetes cluster,
   respectively.
   1. If you are setting up a Cromwell deployment in a Kubernetes cluster (i.e. you used version 4.0.0+ of
   the installer, or you used an older version with the argument `--useaks=true`), then you should set your working
   directory to the `azure_kubernetes` module:

       ```bash
       cd azure_kubernetes
       ```
   2. If you are setting up a Cromwell deployment in a virtual machine (i.e. you used version 3.2.0 or earlier of the
      CromwellOnAzure script, and you did _not_ override the default with `--useaks=true`), then you should set your
      working directory to the `azure_vm` module:

         ```bash
         cd azure_vm
         ```
3. Create a file with variable assignments for your installation, `cromwell.tfvars`, replacing quoted values on the
   right-hand sides with literal values.
   1. If you are using Cromwell in a Kubernetes cluster:

        ```terraform
        subscriptionId            = "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
        resourceGroupName         = "$RESOURCE_GROUP"
        logAnalyticsWorkspaceName = "$LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE"
        virtualNetworkName        = "$VIRTUAL_NETWORK_NAME"
        kubernetesClusterName     = "$KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME"
        storageAccountName        = "$STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME"
        ```
   2. If you are using Cromwell in a virtual machine:

        ```terraform
        subscriptionId            = "$SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
        resourceGroupName         = "$RESOURCE_GROUP"
        logAnalyticsWorkspaceName = "$LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE"
        virtualNetworkName        = "$VIRTUAL_NETWORK_NAME"
        virtualMachineName        = "$VIRTUAL_MACHINE_NAME"
        storageAccountName        = "$STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME"
        ```

   Here is how you can find each of these values:
    * `$SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: use the same ID used when running the Microsoft CromwellOnAzure script.
    * `$RESOURCE_GROUP`: is generated for you by the Microsoft CromwellOnAzure script; consult the output to find the name.
    * `$LOG_ANALYTICS_WORKSPACE`: is generated for you by the Microsoft CromwellOnAzure script; consult the output
      of the CromwellOnAzure script, or run this command using the `$SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and `$RESOURCE_GROUP` from the
      previous points:
      ```bash
      az monitor log-analytics workspace list --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -o json | jq -r '.[].name'
      ```
   * `$VIRTUAL_NETWORK_NAME`: is generated for you by the Microsoft CromwellOnAzure script; consult the output
     of the CromwellOnAzure script, or run this command using the `$SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and `$RESOURCE_GROUP` from the
     previous points:
     ```bash
     az network vnet list --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -o json | jq -r '.[].name'
     ```
   * `$VIRTUAL_MACHINE_NAME` (Cromwell in VM only): is generated for you by the Microsoft CromwellOnAzure script;
     consult the output of the CromwellOnAzure script, or run this command using the `$SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and
     `$RESOURCE_GROUP` from the previous points:
     ```bash
     az vm list --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -o json | jq -r '.[].name'
     ```
   * `$KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME` (Cromwell in Kubernetes only): is generated for you by the Microsoft CromwellOnAzure
     script; consult the output of the CromwellOnAzure script, or run this command using the `$SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and
     `$RESOURCE_GROUP` from the previous points:
     ```bash
     az aks list --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -o json | jq -r '.[].name'
     ```
   * `$STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME`: is generated for you by the Microsoft CromwellOnAzure script; consult the output fo the
     script, or run this command using the `$SUBSCRIPTION_ID` and `$RESOURCE_GROUP` from the previous points:
     ```bash
     az storage account list --subscription $SUBSCRIPTION_ID -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -o json | jq -r '.[].name'
     ```
4. Apply the configuration with your variable assignments:

    ```bash
    terraform apply -var-file=cromwell.tfvars
    ```

   Terraform will print out a plan and ask you to type `yes` before starting. If you are running this for the first
   time, the plan should only add resources (no changes or removals). _Make sure the plan only adds resources
   before accepting!_

## Destroying Installation
Destroying an installation requires two steps:

1. Destroy resources created by Terraform:
    ```bash
    terraform destroy -var-file=cromwell.tfvars
    ```
2. [Delete the resource group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group?tabs=azure-powershell)
containing Cromwell.

## Using the Cromwell Installation
### Getting Deployment Information
There are two pieces of information you need to start using your new Cromwell installation:
* The ingress URL
* The Azure App Registry credentials (ID and secret)

To get the ingress URL, run:
```bash
terraform output --raw ingress_url
```

To get the Azure App Registry client credentials, run:
```bash
terraform output --raw workbench_client_id
terraform output --raw workbench_client_secret
```

### Sending Requests to Cromwell
To send requests to Cromwell, use the App Registration credentials to obtain an OAuth2 access token, and then use
that as a bearer token for requests to the Cromwell API.

After running terraform, this command can be used to obtain an access token and assign it to an environment variable:
```bash
ACCESS_TOKEN="$(
  curl -X POST "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$(terraform output --raw tenantId)/oauth2/v2.0/token" \
    -u "$(terraform output --raw workbench_client_id):$(terraform output --raw workbench_client_secret)" \
    -d grant_type=client_credentials \
    -d scope="$(terraform output --raw workbench_client_id)/.default" \
    | jq -r '.access_token'
)"
```

Now you can send an authenticated request to the Cromwell API:
```bash
curl "$(terraform output --raw ingress_url)/api/ga4gh/wes/v1/service-info" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
